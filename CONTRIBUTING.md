Firstly, thank you for being interested in contributing to BEE7! Please read the following fully in order to understand how to contribute.

# Are you fixing a bug or submitting a pull request?

Before doing so, submit a issue describing the changes/bug you want to add/fix before making a pull request. This is to prevent you spending a week on a feature, then having your pull request denied (If this does happen, sorry â™¥!).

After getting approved to make a pull request, do the following:

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

# What should I include in the pull request?

I have made a template for pull requests, please fill that out before submitting it. If there is anything else you think that is important, please add it.
